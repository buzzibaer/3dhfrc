3D holografic fan remote controll for virtual pinball

## What is this for? The Problem!
I bought a kindly cheap 3D holografic fan from china.
It has a Handy-App for remote controlling it via Wifi.
There is also a Windows App for ending videos for it and controlling it.
But i wanted to control it directly from my virtual pinball cabinet.
The idea ist that if i am going to load up a specific pinball table the fan has to select the corresponding video for the table.
So if you going to load up the table "DarkPrinzess" a topper video is shown on the fan for ambiente purposes.

## The Fan
I bought this device here: [AliExpress Link] (https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000579865125.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.659e4c4dMc6T5K	)
But it seems kindly generic, so maybe it works also for other models
Original Software for App and Desktop came from here >> https://huangbanjin.gitee.io/bergerh/
